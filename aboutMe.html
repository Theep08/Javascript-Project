        <h2>About Me.</h2>

        <h3>A quote I like (reccomend watching the original video).</h3>

        <p>"What do we have beyond this very moment? <br>
            Nothing. <br>
            What is the future, beyond a figment of our imagination, our dreams, our fears... The train not yet left the station. <br>
            Wasted thought. <br>
            What is our past? beyond memories, happy or sad, lessons learned but still just the past had. <br>
            Your gift is this moment, nothing more. <br>
            Embrace it or lose it, for energy spent elsewhere is a waste of your core. <br>
            For it is in this very moment that you are truly alive.  <br>
            A clear mind, focussed and content is that which I strive. <br>
            And in finding this clarity... <br>
            I feel nothing but peace. <br>
            <br>
            Obstacles are placed in our path to test us. <br>
            Some may go round them, some may simply give up trying to pass. <br>
            But it is through choice that I adapt and overcome them.  <br>
            Total dominance over my body to conquer anything in my path. <br>
            <br>
            Effortlessly vaulting one wall, my mind is focussed on every measure of detail. <br>
            Conserving my energy, utilising only that which I need in order to sail. <br>
            From one obstacle to another <br>
            Flowing like water in my forward endeavour. <br>
            <br>
            There is no thought of not making the distance, no consideration of mistakes. <br>
            Only the understanding that I will give each leap my all, doing what ever it takes. <br>
            Landing with control, ready for the next challenge that crosses my path, <br>
            my footprints leading the way, giving everything my all, and never just half. <br>
            <br>
            To achieve is to succeed, and to succeed takes drive, it takes effort and motivation, it's exactly that, that makes me feel so alive! <br>
            But the failures are important, they show us the way, afterall we learn from our mistakes so I'll never take that away. <br>
            If truth be told I'm just trying to be the best I can be, nobody's perfect but nothing is more important to me. <br>
            To be kinder, wiser, and stronger. <br>
            To give more than I receive and never ask for anything in return. <br>
            <br>
            The only person who can ever judge you is yourself, I strive to make myself proud and every day is a blessing to take a step closer to that level of self wealth. <br>
            <br>
            Self expression and creativity are everything to me.  <br>
            We have one life, be sure you do what you want, and be who you want be. <br>
            My movements illustrate the words I ve placed on the page. This is my expression breaking out of my cage. <br>
            <br>
            In this life, nobody gives you shit. <br>
            if you want something, you've got to go out and get it... <br>
            <br>
            With every new day, things can get rough so you gotta be tough, just to want it, is never enough.  <br>
            Don't wish for it, work for it. <br>
            Don't hope for it, get up and get it. <br>
            Don't dream about it, if your not prepared to give it everything you have to earn it. <br>
            <br>
            My dad always told me. <br>
            Take risks, and explore.  <br>
            I found movement and never looked back.  <br>
            <br>
            I wake up every morning with a smile upon my face. <br>
            I'm doing what I love, never mind the ratrace. <br>
            Always searching for a new place, to make my own space, and just trace. <br>
            <br>
            The lines of movement, making them my own.  <br>
            Creating my map with the skills I hone. <br>
            Of course none of them perfect, but none ever will,  <br>
            a continuous development- a work in progress still. <br>
            <br>
            Such is my life, and such is how I love it. <br>
            A blessing in itself, to be perfectly imperfect." (Parkour - Spoken Movement Text:
            Poetry In Motion 3. @SamParham from 3RUN)</p>
